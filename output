The main reason for any page to timeout is that the amount of time it has been since your computer requested a page from the Athens website has been longer than the default threshold set by your browser. <br/> <br/> This could be one of two things.<br/> <br/> 1. There is a lot of network usage and Athens is unable to send back a response to your request in time. The best thing to do is try it a bit later.<br/> <br/> 2. There is a problem with the Athens servers and no pages are being sent out. <br/> <br/> In either case if after a reasonable amount of time you are still getting timeout messages, open a new case on the webhelpdesk and we will investigate the problem on your behalf.<br/> <br/> To open new webhelpdesk case, go to <a href="http://webhelpdesk.mdx.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://webhelpdesk.mdx.ac.uk</a>. login or register your details and complete the simply online case form.
